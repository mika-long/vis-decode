## Key Information about this research study: 
The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is explained later on in this form.
- The purpose of this study is to understand how people visually decode and extract key statistical properties (specifically median and mode) from probability distributions.
- You will be asked to complete a series of visual perception tasks where you make judgments about statistical graphs by looking at them and using an interactive interface to indicate your answers.
- We expect that you will be in this research study for approximately **10 – 20 minutes total**. 
- The primary potential risk of participation is minor temporary eye strain from viewing a computer screen. 
- The main benefit of being in this study is contributing to improved design of statistical visualizations for better public understanding. 

## Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you are an adult (age 18 – 65) who resides in the United States, is fluent in English, and has normal or corrected-to-normal vision. This study aims to understand how people visually perceive and interpret statistical information from probability distribution graphs. Your participation will help us better understand how to design more effective data visualizations for communicating statistical information. 

## How many people will be in this study?
We expect about 120 people will be in this research study.  

## What should I know about participating in a research study?
- Whether or not you take part is up to you.
- You can choose not to take part.
- You can agree to take part and later change your mind.
- Your decision will not be held against you.
- You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.

## What happens if I say, “Yes, I want to be in this research”?
If you agree to be in this research study, here’s what will happen: 
- You will complete a series of visual perception tasks on your computer through a web-based platform. **You must use a desktop or laptop computer with a modern web browser (mobile devides are not allowed).** 
- The study will take approximately **10 – 20 minutes total**, including instructions, training, and the tasks themselves. 
- You will be shown different types of statistical graphs, called **probability density graphs** (PDFs) and **cumulative distribution functions** (CDFs). 
- For each graph, you will be asked to make judgments about specific statistical properties by: 
    - Looking at the graph 
    - Using an interactive interface to mark your answer 
    - Moving on to the next graph when ready 
    - You will be given amply training and instructions on what we’re looking for for each graph. 
    - You will have unlimited time for each judgment, with brief breaks provided throughout the trial. 
    - You will complete **60** trials in total across all tasks, of which 10 are training trials. 
    - The study will automatically record your responses and how long you take to make each judgment. No personally identifying information will be collected. 
    <!-- - You will receive a base payment of **$5** for completing the study, plus the opportunity to earn additional bonues of up to $0.25 per accurate response (up to $10 to $15 in total bonues)  -->
    - You will receive a payment of **$5** for completing the study. 

## Will being in this study help me in any way?
We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, possible benefits include increased awareness of techniques for reading statistical properties from charts through participating in these visual perception tasks. The main benefit of this research will be to the broader scientific community. Your participation will help us: 
- Better understand how people perceive and interpret statistical information from visualizations 
- Develop more effective ways to design and present statistical graphics 
- Improve how probabilitistic information is communicated to help people make better decisions 

## Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?
The risks associated with this study are minimal and similar to those you might experience in daily life while using a computer:
- Physical risks: You may experience minor eye strain or fatigue from viewing the computer screen while completing the visual tasks. These effects are temporary and limited to the study session. You can minimize this by taking short breaks if needed, as there are no strict time restrictions on the tasks.
- Psychological risks: You may feel mild frustration if you find some of the visual perception tasks challenging. To minimize this:
- We provide clear instructions for all tasks
    - You will have practice trials to help you get comfortable with the tasks
    - You can take breaks between trials
    - You can withdraw from the study at any time
    - Economic risks: These are minimal since you will receive the base compensation ($5) for participating. While there are performance-based bonuses, they are designed to encourage effort without creating undue pressure.

## What happens if I do not want to be in this research, or I change my mind later?
Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate.  If you do not want to be in this study or withdraw from the study at any point, your decision will not affect your relationship with Northwestern University/Northwestern Memorial Healthcare.  

Instead of being in this research study, you can choose not to participate at all, or you can look for other studies on Prolific that may better suit your interests or comfort level.

You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.

If you decide to withdraw from this study by closing your browser window or leaving the study platform, any data already collected from you will be destroyed. We will not use partial data from incomplete sessions in our analysis. 

## How will the researchers protect my information?
We have several measures in place to protect your information and maintain confidentiality: 
- We will not collect any personally identifying information like your name, address, phone number, or email address. The only identifier used will be your Prolific ID, which will be used solely for managing compensation.
- All data will be collected through a secure, encrypted web platform (ReVISit.dev). Your responses will be assigned a randomly generated participant ID that is separate from your Prolific ID.All payment information will be handled separately through Prolific's secure payment system.
- Research data will be collected and stored using Firebase, Google's secure cloud platform that provides enterprise-level security including automatic encryption of data at rest.
- Access to the research data will be restricted to authorized research team members through secure authentication methods (including two-factor authentication).
- When we analyze the data, we will only use de-identified data files. Any participant identifiers needed for payment (like Prolific IDs) will be stored separately from the research data.
- We will keep the research data in Firebase and on password-protected machines for a minimum of 3 years after study completion. After this retention period, we will delete the data from Firebase.
- When we share the research data publicly through the Open Science Framework (OSF) to promote research transparency, we will only share the de-identified version that cannot be linked back to individual participants.

## Who will have access to the information collected during this research study?
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. 

There are reasons why information about you may be used or seen by other people beyond the research team during or after this study. Examples include:
- University officials, government officials, study funders, auditors, and the Institutional Review Board may need access to the study information to make sure the study is done in a safe and appropriate manner.  

We will not ask you about child abuse, but if you tell us about child abuse or neglect, we may be required or permitted by law or policy to report to authorities.

## How might the information collected in this study be shared in the future?

We will keep the information we collect about you during this research study for study recordkeeping and for potential use in future research projects.  
De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community, with journals in which study results are published, and with databases and data repositories used for research. We will remove or code any personal information that could directly identify you before the study data are shared. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the anonymity of your personal data.
The results of this study could be shared in articles and presentations, but will not include any information that identifies you unless you give permission for use of information that identifies you in articles and presentations. 

## Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in this study?
You will receive a payment of **$5** for your participation in this study. 
<!-- There will be an additional bonus of $0.25 per correct response, with “correct” defined as within an acceptable margin of error from the true value, resulting in a maximum potential bonus of $10-$15.  -->
The payment will bre released through Prolific within 24 hours of study completion.
<!-- , and the performance bonuses will be calculated and distributed within 48 hours of study completion.  -->
