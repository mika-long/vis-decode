# General Instructions

Here's what to expect:

This experiment consists of **5 blocks of trials**. Each trial has two parts:

1. **Training Part**: You'll complete practice trials to help you familiarize yourself with the task and experiment interface. Performance during this part will not count towards your final compensation.
2. **Testing Part**: You'll complete trials where you'll apply what you learned in the training part. Performance during this part will affect your bonus payment. 

You will complete all trials within each block before moving to the next block. The experiment will guide you through each stage automatically.
